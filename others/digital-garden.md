## _Digital_ what?

This site is a [digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden/), not a blog. I keep it mostly for myself, but I suppose the knowledge here might be helpful to you as well.

The goal of this project is to be a living reference of what I've learnt, what I am interested in and what skills I actually have.

The main value is not in the carefully crafted blog posts full of anectodes, graphs, opinions and else. Instead, it lies in _linking my thinking_. Recently I learn a lot and I want to find patterns that will help me to improve in my field of expertise.

## Non-linearity

Due to a _non-linear_ nature of this site, I might post here ideas, snippets, resources, thoughts, bits of knowledge, projects of mine or basically anything I find interesting and relating to the rest of the content here. It's basically my own, basic Wikipedia.

This also means not everything is going to be well-writen, perfectly organised, or even truthy. Things change, I change, JavaScript frameworks change. It's hard to keep up sometimes and people make mistakes.

The good part is that the whole thing is [open-source](https://github.com/kkoscielniak/the-garden-content), so if you stumble upon something evidently wrong, you can always open a PR.

## Technicals

My digital garden is built on top of the [Obsidian](https://obdidian.md) app and the open-source [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/) project (that itself uses [Hugo](gohugo.io) behind the scenes).

I've modified the Quartz template a bit and I track these changes on [GitHub](https://github.com/kkoscielniak/the-garden). Probably things are going to break a lot when I decide to bump the Quartz version, but I don't care.

For the simplicity sake, I keep the `content/` in a [separate repo](https://github.com/kkoscielniak/the-garden-content) (referenced by Quartz as a `git submodule`). This should ensure that whenever I decide to use a different _gardening_ solution, the content will be safe. However, because of that, occasionally things might be broken (e.g. _last-updated_ feat is not working as of now).
