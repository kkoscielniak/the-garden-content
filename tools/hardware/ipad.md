I use an iPad Mini 6 with Apple Pencil 2 almost exclusively for reading and noting. On rare occasions I watch _Modern Family_ on it as well.

## Apps

I try to keep up the list of installed apps intact, to not lose the purpose of having this device. The list is limited to:

- [[tools/software/kindle|Kindle]]
- Goodnotes
- Reeder
- Netflix, Disney+ etc.
- utilities like Password Manager and 2FA tools

## Others

I use a 3rd party paper-like screen protector from [Nillkin](https://nillkin.org/tablet-accessories/apple-tablets-accessories/apple-ipad-mini-6-accessories/nillkin-apple-ipad-mini-6-2021-ag). 
	- cheaper than the OG Paperlike, yet it seems to be of better quality (!)
		- I have OG Paperlike on the iPad Pro 10.5" I used before
