I read mostly in Kindle app on my [[tools/hardware/ipad|iPad]] or on my [[tools/hardware/iphone|iPhone]] if the iPad's not around.

Thanks to Kindle _ecosystem_ I can keep the books and the highlights in sync.

## Highlighting

I highlight **a lot**. I use different colors for different _types_ of highlights (ideas, links, quotes, useless but funny etc.).

I prefer to read on an [[tools/hardware/ipad|iPad]] due to it's Apple Pencil support - it's way more precise than using finger on eInk. It also brings me more joy.

If I want to add something from myself to the booknotes, I use the [Scribble](https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/ipad355ab2a7/ipados) feature.
