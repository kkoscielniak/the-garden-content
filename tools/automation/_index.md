I tend to automate mundane and repetitive tasks as often as possible through both software and hardware. This, however, is a pretty complex world, so my toolkit and knowledge are limited atm.

## Tools I use

- [Keyboard Maestro](/Tools/apps/Keyboard-Maestro.md)
- [Elgato Stream Deck 2](/Tools/hardware/index.md#Workstation)
- BetterTouchTool
- Raycast
- Shortcuts (iOS)
- Fig.io
