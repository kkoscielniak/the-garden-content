## `$ whoami`

My name is Krystian Kościelniak. I’m a proud husband and father to a sneaky toddler.

I [write code](https://github.com/kkoscielniak) for a living. Whenever I am not doing that or looking after my kiddo’, I [read](/reading/), learn about [cybersecurity](/cybersecurity/), [web3](/web3/), play video games or try to make sample-based boombap beats.

In 2023 I've been diagnosed with ADHD.

## What's this place?

This is my [digital garden](others/digital-garden) for sharing what I learn in public.

You may roam around freely or use `⌘+K` for a site-wide search.

## Wanna talk?

Just drop me <a href="mailto:krystiankoscielniak@proton.me">an email</a>, or DM me on [Insta](https://instagram.com/pankoscielniak). I don’t check LinkedIn a lot.
