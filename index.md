# `$ whoami`

My name is Krystian Kościelniak. I’m a proud husband and father to a sneaky toddler.

I [write code](https://github.com/kkoscielniak) for a living. Whenever I am not doing that or looking after my kiddo’, I [read](/reading/reading-list), [experiment](/Projects/index.md), play video games or try to make sample-based boombap beats.

In 2023 I've been diagnosed with [ADHD](/ADHD/index.md). I am still exploring that superpower.

## What's this place?

This is my [digital garden](/About/digital-garden.md) for sharing what I learn in public. It's messy by design.

You may roam around freely or use `⌘+K` for a site-wide search.

## Wanna talk?

Just drop me <a href="mailto:krystian@koscielniak.pro">an email</a>, or DM me on [Insta](https://instagram.com/pankoscielniak). I don’t check [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krystian-koÅ9Bcielniak-629102a7/) a lot (but you may try as well).
