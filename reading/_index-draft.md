<!-- If you're curious about how I read, [[books/reading |take a look]]. -->

## Currently reading

- [The Pentester's Blueprint](https://www.amazon.com/Pentester-BluePrint-Your-Guide-Being/dp/1119684307) - Phillip L. Wylie, Kim Crawley

## 2022

- 🎧 [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692?tag=radexio-20) - Cal Newport - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
  - Describes why the _deep work_ matters and provides lots of ideas how to improve the day-to-day work
  - Helps to change our habits regarding focused work. I am still implementing those ideas
- 📱 [Programowanie na Autopilocie](https://pna.zautomatyzowani.pl/) 🇵🇱 - Adam Gospodarczyk ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
  - Very similar to _Codzienność na Autopilocie_, but given the latter was constantly expanded with content and bonuses, I hope this will be the same case 😉

* 📱 [Codzienność na Autopilocie](https://codziennosc.zautomatyzowani.pl/) 🇵🇱 - Adam Gospodarczyk - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
  - teaches how to make the work-supporting environment
  - provides ideas on how to [[process/automation|automate]] the mundane tasks
  - it's a book that constantly evolves

- 📱 [One Small Step Can Change Your Life: The Kaizen Way](https://www.amazon.com/Small-Step-Change-Your-Life/dp/076118032X/) - Robert Maurer - ⭐️⭐️⭐️
  - short introduction to the method of small steps. Wasn't as informative as I thought
  - [[reading/notes/kaizen|booknotes]] 🇵🇱

## 2021

- 🎧 [Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less](https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382) - Greg McKeown - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

  - teaches how to focus more on the essential, instead of trying to keep up with every option possible

- 🎧 [Ego is the Enemy](http://egoistheenemy.com) - Ryan Holiday - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

  - a solid reminder of who's the enemy at every point in life

- 🎧 [The Checklist Manifesto](https://www.amazon.com/The-Checklist-Manifesto-audiobook/dp/B0031Q9ZWY) - Atul Gawande - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

  - stories from different industries that show how awesome the checklists are, but without any specifics, templates etc.

- 📱 [The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up](https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308) - Marie Kondo - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
  - lessons from this one (and from [this Netflix's piece](https://www.netflix.com/pl-en/title/80209379)) helped us to _throw_ out ~15 bags of clutter right before our kiddo was born
    - just filter out the metaphysical bullshit and it's brilliant

## 2020

- 📱 [Manhood: How to Be a Better Man-or Just Live with One](https://www.amazon.com/Manhood-Better-Man-Just-Live-ebook/dp/B00H6JHR5E) - Terry Crews - ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

  - Terry's memoir about his lifelong quest to become who he is now. A bitter-sweet read.
  - lots of focus on the topic of porn addiction and _man-upping_

- 📕 [Create or Hate](https://www.amazon.com/Create-Hate-Successful-People-Things/dp/0995404445/) - Dan Norris - ⭐️⭐️
  - it was meant to be a short, inspiring, one-evening book, but the idea to personify the Creativity and Hatred broke everything

📱 - eBook | 🎧 - audiobook | 📕 - paperback
