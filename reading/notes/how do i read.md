title: How do I read?
draft: true
---

I read in both English and Polish (depending on the source material). Sometimes I read a book twice in both languages (e.g. English audiobook + Polish eBook) to make sure I am not missing anything.

## eBooks

Because of notetaking and sync features I read eBooks mostly. Usually I read in the [[tools/kindle-app|Kindle]] app on the [[tools/hardware/ipad|iPad]] or the [[tools/hardware/iphone|iPhone]])

### Notetaking

I [[tools/kindle-app#ZakreÅ›lanie|highlight]] a lot. I use these highlight to make [[books/books|booknotes]] shortly after finishing a book.

I also have lots of unfinished books on my plate. When I want to get back to one, I create the booknotes from the highlights I already made to remember what the book was about and continue reading from where I finished.

To make booknotes I export the highlights to HTML file and process them one by one in code editor.

## Audiobooks

Usually I read audiobooks when I am _driving_ my daughters stroller outside. Occasionally in my car, but these days I don't drive alone this much.

### Notetaking

It's impossible for audiobooks (thanks for nothing, Sherlock ðŸ¤“). The Audible app allows to make some bookmarks, but I am not going over these to listen particular sentences again.

In case of audiobooks, I usually google 3-5 summaries, and make my own booknotes basing on these.

## Why bother with notetaking?

It helps me to remember the key takeaways of the book at hand. I use them as the reference as well.

Also, it helps me to practice [[quotes/jordan-peterson-writing|writing]].
