## Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Krystian KoÅ›cielniak.Â Iâ€™m a proud husband and father to a sneaky toddler.

I [write code](https://github.com/kkoscielniak)Â for a living, currently at [Pickatale](https://pickatale.com/). Whenever I am not doing that or looking after my kiddoâ€™, I [read](https://koscielniak.pro/books/books), play video games or try to make sample-based boombap beats.

## What is this place?

This is myÂ _**digital garden**_, my own corner in the web for sharing what I learn in public.

It's pretty empty at the moment, as I am going through a bit of maintenance atm. 

## Wanna talk? 
Just drop me <a href="mailto:krystiankoscielniak@proton.me">an email</a>, or DM me on [Insta](https://instagram.com/pankoscielniak). I donâ€™t check LinkedIn a lot.
