## `whoami`

My name is Krystian Kościelniak. I’m a proud husband and father to a sneaky toddler.

I [write code](https://github.com/kkoscielniak) for a living, currently at [Pickatale](https://pickatale.com/). Whenever I am not doing that or looking after my kiddo’, I [read](/reading/), play video games or try to make sample-based boombap beats.

## What's this place?

This is my _**digital garden**_, my own corner in the web for sharing what I learn in public.

It's pretty empty at the moment, as I am going through a bit of maintenance.

## Wanna talk? 
Just drop me <a href="mailto:krystiankoscielniak@proton.me">an email</a>, or DM me on [Insta](https://instagram.com/pankoscielniak). I don’t check LinkedIn a lot.
