title: Red vs Blue Teams
---
Both [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/red-team|red team]] and [[blue-team]] work **toward** improving an organization's security, but they do so differently: 
- A red team plays the role of the attacker by trying to find vulnerabilities and break through cybersecurity defenses
- A blue team defends against attacks and responds to incidents when they occur. They also use the red team's findings to harden their networks

The [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/purple-team|purple team]] may exist within the organisation as well.
