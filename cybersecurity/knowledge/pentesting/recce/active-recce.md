title: Active Reconnaissance
---

Contrary to [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/recce/passive-recce]], _Active_ reconnaissance requires you to make some kind of contact with your target, eg.

- a phone call
- visit the target company under some [[pretext]]
- direct connection to the target system
  - visiting their website
  - checking if their firewall has an SSH port open
- inspecting their windows and door locks

> [!danger] Mind the [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/SOW]]
>
> It is essential to remember not to engage in active reconnaissance work before getting signed legal authorization from the client.

## Tools

- [[cybersecurity/knowledge/pentesting/recce/recce-with-browser]]
  - the browser can be _armed_ to become an efficient recon framework
- [[cybersecurity/knowledge/tools/ping]]
- [[traceroute]]
- telnet
- netcat

## Traces

Any connection might leave information in the logs showing the client IP address, time of the connection, and duration of the connection, etc. Not all connections are suspicious - it's possible to make the reconnaissance appear as regular client activity (e.g. web browsing).
