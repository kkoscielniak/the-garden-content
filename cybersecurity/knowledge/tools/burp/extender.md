title: Burp Extender
---

The Burp Suite *Extender* module can quickly and easily load extensions into the framework, as well as providing a marketplace to download third-party modules (referred to as the "BApp Store"). These can be written in Java, Python (using [Jython](https://www.jython.org/)), or Ruby (using [JRuby](https://www.jruby.org/)).

Whilst many of these extensions require a professional license to download and add in, there are still a fair number that can be integrated with Burp Community. For example, we may wish to extend the inbuilt logging functionality of Burp Suite with the [Logger++](https://github.com/portswigger/logger-plus-plus) module.
