title: Design Patterns
---

_Design Patterns_ are elegant solutions to repeating problems in software design, for example:

- the Undo mechanism ([[memento]] pattern)

Design Patterns show how to structure classes, and how these classes should talk to each other.

Usually Design Patterns are split into three categories:

- creational patterns
  - they are about different ways to **create** objects
- structural patterns
  - about the **relationships between** these objects
- behavioural patterns
  - about the **communication/interaction between** these objects

There are many unofficial and undocumented patterns out there that you might find useful in certain situations.

One of the goal is to minimize [[development/design-patterns/coupling]].
