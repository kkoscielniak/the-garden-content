title: function

In [[web3/solidity/_index]], function execution always needs to start with an external caller. A [[web3/smart-contracts|smart-contract]] will just sit on the blockchain doing nothing until someone calls one of its functions. So there will always be aÂ [[web3/solidity/msg.sender|msg.sender]].

- [[web3/solidity/address]]
- [[web3/solidity/require]]
- [[web3/solidity/assert]]
