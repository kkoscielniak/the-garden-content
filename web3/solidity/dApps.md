title: dApp
---

_decentralised App_ is an application that can work autonomously, usually through [[web3/smart-contracts]] that lives on [[web3/blockchain]].

Contrary to the traditional, centralised apps a dApp can work without human's intervention and is not a proprierty of anyone. The ownership of a dApp is based on and represented by [[web3/ethereum/tokens]].
