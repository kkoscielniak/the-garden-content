Developing a front-end in web3 doesn't differ much from the web2. The main difference is to use [[web3/crypto-wallet]] for authorization, authentication and interaction with the web application.

## Libraries

- [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/en/v1.8.0/)
- [[web3/frontend/ethers|ethers.js]]
- [react-wagmi](https://wagmi.sh)
