title: Oracle
---

An _oracle_ is any entity or device that connects a deterministic [[web3/blockchain]] with [[off-chain]] data (and vice-versa).

Oracles are used to provide external data to the [[web3/Smart contracts]]. They serve as a middleware between the blockchain and the external APIs.

The oracles enter every data input through an external transaction.

The oracles solve [[web3/api-connectivity-problem]].

However, they are prone to the [[web3/single-point-of-failure]] problem.

> _Oracles_ and _data providers_ are not the same thing. Confusingly, sometimes that is the case: a company that provides a data stream will themselves act as the oracle delivering that data to a user directly.
