They enable the extraction and reuse of stateful logic across multiple components without using [HOCs](/Knowledge/React/HOCs.md) or [render-props](/Knowledge/React/render-props.md).

They also allow handling the functional component's state without converting them into class components (hence the name, we _hook_ into [React](/Knowledge/React/index.md) features).

The state, references etc. don't live in the [functional-components](/Knowledge/React/functional-components.md), the components just _hook_ to them on each render.
