# `React.lazy()`

`React.lazy()` allows to load components asynchronously in [index](Knowledge/React/index.md). 

It returns the component that was loaded asynchronously in the background. It is **mandatory** to add [[Knowledge/React/React.Suspense]] component that defines the fallback UI for when the component isn't loaded.
