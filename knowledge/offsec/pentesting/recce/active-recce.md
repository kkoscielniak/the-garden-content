title: Active Reconnaissance
---

Contrary to [passive-recce](/knowledge/offsec/pentesting/recce/passive-recce.md), _Active_ reconnaissance requires you to make some kind of contact with your target, eg.

- a phone call
- visit the target company under some [pretext](/pretext)
- direct connection to the target system
  - visiting their website
  - checking if their firewall has an SSH port open
  - connecting to their servers (HTTP, FTP etc.)
- inspecting their windows and door locks

> [!danger] Mind the [SOW](/knowledge/offsec/pentesting/SOW.md)

> It is essential to remember not to engage in active reconnaissance work before getting signed legal authorization from the client.

## Tools

- [recce-with-browser](/knowledge/offsec/pentesting/recce/recce-with-browser.md)
  - the browser can be _armed_ to become an efficient recon framework
- [ping](/knowledge/offsec/tools/ping.md)
- [traceroute](/knowledge/offsec/tools/traceroute.md)
- [telnet](/knowledge/offsec/tools/telnet.md)
- [netcat](/knowledge/offsec/tools/netcat.md)

## Traces

Any connection might leave information in the logs showing the client IP address, time of the connection, and duration of the connection, etc. Not all connections are suspicious - it's possible to make the reconnaissance appear as regular client activity (e.g. web browsing).
