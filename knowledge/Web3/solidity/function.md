title: function
---

In [index](/Knowledge/Web3/solidity/index.md), function execution always needs to start with an external caller. A [smart-contract](/Knowledge/Web3/smart-contracts.md) will just sit on the blockchain doing nothing until someone calls one of its functions. So there will always be aÂ [msg.sender](/Knowledge/Web3/solidity/msg.sender.md).
