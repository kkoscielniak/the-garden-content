title: dApp
---

_decentralised App_ is an application that can work autonomously, usually through [smart-contracts](/Knowledge/Web3/smart-contracts.md) that lives on [blockchain](/Knowledge/Web3/blockchain.md).

Contrary to the traditional, centralised apps a dApp can work without human's intervention and is not a proprierty of anyone. The ownership of a dApp is based on and represented by [tokens](/Knowledge/Web3/ethereum/tokens.md).
