# dot-cross

> [!info] The name is not final, treat it as a codename ;-)

A _Bullet Journal_ app with Notion-like experience. Blazing fast UI. No fuss. Google Calendar Integration. External API. Mobile app (at some point).

## Status

In development, nothing more to share yet.

## Why?

I've been using the paper-based Bullet Journal for around 2 years now and now I want to have one in _the cloud_. The existing apps are bloated.
