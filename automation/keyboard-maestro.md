title: Keyboard Maestro
---

[Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com) is an app that allows to automate tasks within macOS. Think: Shortcuts, but on steroids.

I call the Keyboard Maestro macros with hotkeys or with an extension for [[Raycast]], but some triggers can be automated as well, eg. connecting an USB device.

## Things I automate

- googling the selected text with **âŒ˜ â‡§ 1**
- opening Google Maps with the route and ETA to provided destination
- text expanding
  - e.g. by typing `;invoice` I make KM to type full message of my typical invoice e-mail
- translating selected text
- opening my favorites directories in Finder from everywhere
- [[automation/favorite-km-macro|copying samples to my MPC Live]] once I connect it to my computer
- sorting
- etc. etc.

Even though these examples are basic, it feels right to automate these activities. I've learnt a lot about the application itself whan I was making these scenarios.
