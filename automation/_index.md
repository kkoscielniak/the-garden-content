I tend to automate mundane and repetitive tasks as often as possible through both software and hardware. This, however, is a pretty complex world, so my toolkit and knowledge are limited atm.

## Tools I use

- [[automation/keyboard-maestro|Keyboard Maestro]]
- Elgato Stream Deck
- BetterTouchTool
- Raycast
- Shortcuts (iOS)
